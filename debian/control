Description: Flexible platform for generating kernel, initramfs images
 Genkernel is a platform designed to help users build kernel and
 initramfs images.  It provides several configuration options to
 support particular hardware setups and sports a flexible initramfs
 script library to allow booting from many types of devices.
 .
 Genkernel's initramfs supports a variety of systems such as LVM2,
 EVMS, aufs, UnionFS, LUKS, as well as various netbooting options.  It
 can also provide LiveCD-style autoconfiguration of devices using
 kernel modules with special parameters.
