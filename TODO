Things to fix:

* Put up an http://genkernel.org/dist/ repository, and auto-download
  the needed files to local cache if needed

* Use "make kernelversion" in the kernel tree to determine the kernel version safely
  (replace the grep/sed/blah version checking with that)

* Fix the "create kbuild_output" side effect of get_KV()

* cmdline kernel config parameter changing (what? jf)

* make some functions more generic .. ( not necessary right away but would be nice to get done )

* make critical variables (arch, etc) bombproof and readonly so modules can't b0rk things
  up

* --list-module-groups for gmi

* gmi: We need modules in the sense that you can just add an overlay
  and the initramfs scripts will pick up the .sh and run it.  

  Perhaps some "preroot" and "postroot" directories, containing
  scripts that get executed before the mounting and, well, after
  Dropping scripts there would ensure execution.  What about the
  execution order?

busybox: fix config (add --busybox-networking opt or something)

general: "Failed to compile" errors need to produce backtrace & etc...

kernel modules --no doesnt work

* reduce --help indentation to make things more readable
* --help should go to stderr
* console=ttyS0,9600 goes kaboom

when you don't have a kernel driver and you ip=dhcp <-- it should say no
such device or so.

the print_info command is going to need some work too
 I think when it dumps stuff to the debugfile
 it should automatically strip color codes

# Single cpio option must be run as root .. die if not root.
    -> mknod fails as a regular user. :/
    look into gen_init_cpio or cpio --append to see if we cant work around
    the dev node issues.
