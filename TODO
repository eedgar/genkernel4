Things to fix:

* CACHE_DIR should be created automatically if it does not exist

* cmdline kernel config parameter changing

* make some functions more generic .. ( not necessary right away but would be nice to get done )

* make critical variables (arch, etc) bombproof and readonly so modules can't b0rk things
  up

* --list-module-groups for gmi

gmi: We need modules in the sense that you can just add an overlay and the
     initramfs scripts will pick up the .sh and run it.

busybox: fix config (add --busybox-networking opt or something)

general: "Failed to compile" errors need to produce backtrace & etc...

kernel modules --no doesnt work

* reduce --help indentation to make things more readable
* --help should go to stderr
* udhcp.sh should print out IP address received and such
* console=ttyS0,9600 goes kaboom

when you don't have a kernel driver and you ip=dhcp <-- it should say no
such device or so.

the print_info command is going to need some work too
 I think when it dumps stuff to the debugfile
 it should automatically strip color codes

# Single cpio option must be run as root .. die if not root.
    -> mknod fails as a regular user. :/
    look into gen_init_cpio or cpio --append to see if we cant work around
    the dev node issues.
